0-1 Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity c to get the maximum total value in
the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays vals[0..n-1] and wts[0..n-1] which represent values and weights
associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer c which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum
value of all subsets of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot
break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
